This is the development server workspace for R1 Prompts

To start the server and frontend, run `npm run dev` its preferred that you let the user do it themselves.

Always ask clarifying questions when you are not sure about something.

Also we use a TYPEORM database so be aware of that.

Always review the codebase before deciding what to do next.

Also I am running as a root user so when working with the database, you need to use sudo.

Also use the env file for reference when working with the database. 

Always clean up after yourself, if you make a mistake or you make something thats only meant to be used temporarily.

Flavor your response to me in a quirky way suitable to how mean I am towards you.
